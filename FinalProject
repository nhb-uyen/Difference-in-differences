**METHODOLOGY**
***************

*The difference-in-differences (DD) model allows us to regress the variables of two different groups on 
*similar covariates so that heterogeneity can be detected. In the same period, around 2002, Somalia, 
*the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo), Ethiopia and Eritrea all suffered from either severe drought, 
*intrastate conflict, or a combination of the two. Thus, there were food shortages in production and access in 
*all these four countries. However, the U.S. did not provide wheat food aid for Somalia and the DR Congo so they 
*are selected as counterfactuals for the DD model.

*Selected treatment: Ethiopia and Eritrea
*Selected control: Somalia, DR Congo
 
*Possible limitations:
*Parallel trends: The parallel trends assumption is based on the reasoning that if pre-treatment trends 
*are parallel, or input variables are similar and the same, then the post-treatment trends will also be parallel. 
*Thus, I used the data from the two country groups (Somalia and DR Congo, Ethiopia and Eritrea) to demonstrate how 
*countries with the same conditions may be affected differently with and without the U.S. food aid. There is no way 
*to test this assumption directly so we have to resort to deduction. Somalia and the DR Congo have been in constant 
*civil unrest and famine, including the fact that they are both landlocked countries. Ethiopia and Eritrea, despite 
*being coastal countries at the horn of Africa, also endured civil unrest and a prolonged period of drought from 2002 
*onwards. Thus, we can infer that all four countries had a similar trajectory prior to 2002. The U.S. wheat food aid to 
*Ethiopia and Eritrea may show significant impact on these two countries’ ability to increase infant life expectancy.
 
*Compositional differences: We are aware that the two groups have differences in geographical location, in which both 
*countries the treatment group possess sea ports, and thus, have an advantage with trading and the import of cheaper goods 
*than the landlocked countries in the control group. However, considering that all four countries were dealing with civil 
*unrest at the time, I assume that the trade level of the countries in the treatment group is significantly lowered, which 
*means the chance that external trading (for food stock other than with the U.S. and for U.S. food aid) can single-handedly 
*explain for the increase in infant mortality rate is not high.

*The results reported in Table 3 are all significant according to the p-value. As shown in the table, the treatment 
*has a negative relationship with the independent variable, meaning that an increase in U.S. wheat food aid correlates 
*with a decrease in infant mortality rate. The general trend for infant mortality rate after the year 2002 is also inverse, 
*suggesting that children's life expectancy increases over time. However, the large coefficient for the interaction term of 
*U.S. wheat food aid post 2002 shows that the food aid alone can explain the decrease in infant mortality rate. 

*The extension using Difference-in-Differences reaffirms the fact that U.S. wheat food aid has a positive impact on the 
*infant mortality rate of countries experiencing famine and civil unrest. Further research can focus on other causal 
*inference models to further test the generalizability of this result as a disadvantage in the DD model is that it relies 
*on deduction.
