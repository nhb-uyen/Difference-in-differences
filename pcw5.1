// For two bedroom houses, one unit increase in price results in 7.7 unit increase in living area and .3 increase in age. 
// For three bedroom house, one unit increase in price results in 6 unit increase in living area and .03 decrease in age. 
// For four bedroom houses, one unit increase in price results in 5.8 unit increase in living area and .01 decrease in age. 
// Overall, the relationships are statistically significant but not economically significant. 
// There is almost no difference in age for three and four bedroom houses, although the age difference for two bedroom houses 
// is not much more significant at .3 unit. 
// The difference in pricing for two bedroom houses are the most beneficial for home buyers because the area increase is the 
// largest per price unit.
